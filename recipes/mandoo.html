        <p>
            <strong>Mandoo</strong>, <em>also known as mandu</em>, refers to Korean-style dumplings. They are typically filled with a mixture of ground meat (often pork), 
            vegetables, and seasonings, and then steamed, boiled, or pan-fried. The dumpling wrappers can be made with flour, water, and salt or with 
            other ingredients like rice flour or potato starch to create a chewier texture. There are many variations of mandoo fillings, including kimchi, 
            seafood, and tofu, and they can be served as a snack or as a main course, often with dipping sauces like soy sauce, vinegar, or chili paste. Mandoo 
            is a popular dish in Korean cuisine and can be found in many Korean restaurants and markets around the world.
