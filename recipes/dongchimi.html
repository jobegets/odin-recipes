        <p>
            <strong>Dongchimi</strong> is a type of water-based kimchi that is made with daikon radish, napa cabbage, and other vegetables. The word "dongchimi" literally 
            means "winter water kimchi," as it is traditionally eaten in the winter months. Dongchimi is known for its clear, refreshing flavor and crunchy texture. It is
             often served as a side dish to rich or spicy main dishes in Korean cuisine. Additionally, the liquid from dongchimi, called "dongchimi water," is a popular 
             beverage in Korea, particularly during the hot summer months, as it is believed to have a cooling effect on the body.
