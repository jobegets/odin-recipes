        <p><strong>Bulgogi</strong> (Beef) is a popular Korean dish that typically consists of thin slices of beef marinated in a sweet and 
            savory sauce made with soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, sugar, and other ingredients. The beef is then grilled or stir-fried until tender and caramelized, 
            and is often served with rice, lettuce leaves, and other side dishes. Bulgogi literally means "fire meat" in Korean, and the dish is known for its rich 
            flavor and tender texture. It is a beloved dish in Korean cuisine and has gained popularity around the world.
